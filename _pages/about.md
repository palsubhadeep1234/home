Hello! I am Subhadeep Pal, a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanics, Materials & Structures at Northwestern University. I am supervised by Prof. Sinan Keten in the [Computational Nanodynamics Laboratory](https://keten-group.northwestern.edu/). Throughout my doctoral studies, I developed expertise in multi-scale modeling, computational mechanics, and advanced machine learning techniques, which I successfully applied to
polymer nanocomposites to explain stiffness enhancement and energy absorption pathways, self-healing thermosets to establish percolation thresholds, and cementitious materials to understand rheology, from a molecular point of view, unseen from experiments. My overarching goal is to become an expert computational engineer and bridge gaps between molecular physics and mesoscale failure phenomena broadly in soft materials.


### Research vision
I aim to turn molecular insight into predictive, decision-making tools for materials design. Current directions:
- **Mechanotargeted drug delivery:** coupling PGN mechanics with ECM mechanics to predict transport and uptake; multiscale integration from CG-MD → GP surrogates → FEM.
- **Polymer circularity & recycling:** **MLIP-MD → kMC → FEM** to model bond-exchange kinetics, damage, and reprocessability in dynamic networks and recyclable epoxies.
- **Scalable modeling:** particle-based coarse-graining (e.g., ICPM) to reach micron-scale mechanics without sacrificing chemistry-specific trends.

### Highlights
- **Fellowships & awards:** Ryan Fellowship (IIN, NU); finalist, **Frank J. Padden, Jr. Award** (APS DPOLY); multiple competitive travel awards (SES, USNCCM).  
- **Publications (selected):** *Macromolecules* (2023), *Soft Matter* (2024), *J. Chem. Phys.* (2024), *Advanced Materials* (2025), *Phys. Rev. Lett.* (2025, Editor’s Suggestion), *ACS Macro Lett.* (2024), *Proc. R. Soc. A* (2021).  
- **Service & teaching:** Reviewer for journals across soft matter and materials; TA/Grader for graduate FEM and structural dynamics.  
- **Collaboration:** Work closely with experimental groups on indentation, rheology, and super-resolution imaging; joint projects with ARL, UC Berkeley, Columbia, and others.

### Recent/ongoing projects
- **Multicomponent PGNs:** CG-MD + GP/BO to discover packing rules that simultaneously raise modulus and toughness; micron-scale mechanics via particle models.  
- **Shear and impact response of PGN films:** micro-ballistic and shear simulations to connect graft architecture, NP volume fraction, and cohesive energy with penetration and stiffness metrics.  
- **Mixed-hardener epoxies:** chemistry-specific CG-MD with continuum fracture models to quantify how hardener composition shifts yield and toughness.  
- **Cement paste rheology (for 3D printing):** nanoscale PMF calculations informing meso-scale flow models and rate-dependent viscosity.
