I am a Ph.D. candidate at Northwestern University (Keten Lab) working at the interface of **computational mechanics**, **molecular simulation**, and **machine learning**. I develop methods that connect **chemistry-specific CG-MD** to **Gaussian-process metamodels** and **Bayesian optimization** to uncover design rules for **polymer-grafted nanoparticles (PGNs)** and thermoset networks.

My research explains how nanoscale architecture governs **modulus, yield, and fracture toughness**, and provides predictive tools that navigate the **strength–toughness trade-off**. I’m extending these ideas in two directions:  
1) **Mechanotargeted drug delivery**, where matrix mechanics and NP mechanics jointly control transport and uptake;  
2) **Polymer circularity**, using **MLIP-MD → kMC → FEM** to model bond exchange, damage, and reprocessability in recyclable or dynamic networks.

I collaborate closely with experimental groups and emphasize **active-learning loops** that prioritize the most informative simulations/experiments. I enjoy building open, reproducible tools for the community.

**Keywords:** PGNs, polymer nanocomposites, fracture, multiscale modeling, MLIP-MD, kMC, FEM, uncertainty quantification.
