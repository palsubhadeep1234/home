I am **Subhadeep Pal**, a final-year Ph.D. candidate in **Mechanics, Materials & Structures** at **Northwestern University (Keten Lab)**. I build **multiscale, data-efficient modeling workflows** that link chemistry-specific **coarse-grained MD**, **Gaussian-process metamodels**, and **Bayesian optimization** to explain and design the mechanics of **polymer-grafted nanoparticles (PGNs)**, thermosets, and related soft composites. My work focuses on nanoscale failure mechanisms, the **strength–toughness trade-off**, and structure→property maps under uncertainty.

### Research vision
I aim to turn molecular insight into predictive, decision-making tools for materials design. Current directions:
- **Mechanotargeted drug delivery:** coupling PGN mechanics with ECM mechanics to predict transport and uptake; multiscale integration from CG-MD → GP surrogates → FEM.
- **Polymer circularity & recycling:** **MLIP-MD → kMC → FEM** to model bond-exchange kinetics, damage, and reprocessability in dynamic networks and recyclable epoxies.
- **Scalable modeling:** particle-based coarse-graining (e.g., ICPM) to reach micron-scale mechanics without sacrificing chemistry-specific trends.

### Highlights
- **Fellowships & awards:** Ryan Fellowship (IIN, NU); finalist, **Frank J. Padden, Jr. Award** (APS DPOLY); multiple competitive travel awards (SES, USNCCM).  
- **Publications (selected):** *Macromolecules* (2023), *Soft Matter* (2024), *J. Chem. Phys.* (2024), *Advanced Materials* (2025), *Phys. Rev. Lett.* (2025, Editor’s Suggestion), *ACS Macro Lett.* (2024), *Proc. R. Soc. A* (2021).  
- **Service & teaching:** Reviewer for journals across soft matter and materials; TA/Grader for graduate FEM and structural dynamics.  
- **Collaboration:** Work closely with experimental groups on indentation, rheology, and super-resolution imaging; joint projects with ARL, UC Berkeley, Columbia, and others.

### Recent/ongoing projects
- **Multicomponent PGNs:** CG-MD + GP/BO to discover packing rules that simultaneously raise modulus and toughness; micron-scale mechanics via particle models.  
- **Shear and impact response of PGN films:** micro-ballistic and shear simulations to connect graft architecture, NP volume fraction, and cohesive energy with penetration and stiffness metrics.  
- **Mixed-hardener epoxies:** chemistry-specific CG-MD with continuum fracture models to quantify how hardener composition shifts yield and toughness.  
- **Cement paste rheology (for 3D printing):** nanoscale PMF calculations informing meso-scale flow models and rate-dependent viscosity.
