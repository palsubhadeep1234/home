### Micro-Ballistic Performance of PGN Thin-Film Monolayers  
*Advisor: Dr. Sinan Keten*  
**2022 – 2024**

- Performed micro-ballistic **LIPIT** simulations on coarse-grained SiO₂–PMMA **polymer-grafted nanoparticle (PGN)** films to study how **graft chain length** and **NP core density** affect ballistic performance, leveraging PGNs’ **remarkable mechanical properties**.
- Identified a positive relation between **cohesive energy density** and **specific penetration energy** \(E_p^\*\), and a failure-mode shift from **segment pull-out** to **fragmentation** for shorter grafts due to **lower cohesion**.
- Proposed a new ballistic metric, **average deceleration rate of the bullet** \(A_b\). Found **intermediate graft lengths** \((N \approx 40–100)\) optimize both \(E_p^\*\) and \(A_b\), suggesting designs for **impact-resistant** coatings where backface deformation must stay low.

### Characterizing the Shear Response of PGNs  
*Advisors/Collaborators: Dr. Sinan Keten; Arman Moussavi; Dr. Zhenghao Wu (Xi’an Jiaotong University)*  
**2022 – 2023**

- Built PGN models with **Kremer–Grest beads** and **FENE** bonds to probe shear response across NP core radius, grafting density, and chain length; observed a **linear** relation between **NP volume fraction** and **modulus**.
- Showed PGNs with **short grafts** have **higher stiffness** than linear polymer melts due to **NP reinforcement**, indicating routes to **stronger polymer composites** (helpful for reducing reliance on single-use plastics).

### Predicting Mechanical and Fracture Properties of Mixed-Hardener Epoxies  
*Advisors/Collaborators: Dr. Sinan Keten; Dr. Timothy Sirk (ARL); Dr. Kerim Dansuk (Boğaziçi University); Dr. Andrea Giuntoli (University of Groningen)*  
**2022 – 2023**

- Used a **chemistry-specific** coarse-grained model to study how **mixed hardeners** tune epoxy **failure mechanisms** and the **strength–toughness trade-off**.
- Estimated **fracture toughness** via a continuum fracture model informed by simulations that **captured experimental trends**.
- Found **intermediate-length** Jeffamine chains **enhance toughness** while maintaining modulus, yielding a **predictive framework** for less-brittle epoxy design.

### A Catch-Bond Mechanism with Looped Adhesive Tethers  
*Advisors/Collaborators: Dr. Sinan Keten; Dr. Kerim Dansuk (Boğaziçi University)*  
**2021 – 2023**

- Designed a **molecular NP system** that mimics **catch-bond** behavior using **looped** and **straight** tethers for load sharing under force; simulations showed a **force-enhanced lifetime** curve.
- Derived an **analytical relation** (validated by molecular and Monte-Carlo simulations) to tune loop/adhesion interactions, enabling **customizable** catch-bond lifetimes for **self-strengthening materials**.

### Development of a Many-Body Potential for a Particle-Based PGN Model  
*Advisors/Collaborators: Dr. Sinan Keten; Dr. Wei Chen; Dr. Sanat K. Kumar (Columbia); Dr. Zhenghao Wu (Xi’an Jiaotong University)*  
**2024 – Present**

- Advanced the **Implicit Chain Particle Model (ICPM)** representing each PGN as a **single bead**, achieving ~**10⁷× speed-up** over all-atom models while **accurately predicting** bulk modulus and toughness.
- Built **two- and three-body** interaction forms from strain-energy functions, complemented by an **ML model** trained on simulation data, enabling **micron-scale simulations** beyond traditional MD length-scale limits.

### Understanding Cement Paste Rheology for 3D-Printing Applications  
*Advisors/Collaborators: Dr. Sinan Keten; Dr. Faramarz Joodaki; Dr. Gianluca Cusatis*  
**2023 – Present**

- Created a **nanoscale** C3S–water model and computed **potential of mean force (PMF)** between cement surfaces across water contents to inform a **micron-scale** rheology model.
- Simulated **nozzle flow** in 3D printing and found **viscosity decreases** with increasing shear rate and water-to-cement ratio, matching rheological expectations.

### Real-Time Super-Resolution Imaging of Polymer-Chain Conformational Changes  
*Advisors/Collaborators: Dr. Sinan Keten; Ruiqi Xiao; Dr. Muzhou Wang*  
**2023 – 2024**

- Built **finite-element models** of bottlebrush-polymer thin films with rigid indentation and frictional contact to mirror experiments (scaling to ~**10⁷** DOF in **ABAQUS**).
- Quantified **single-chain orientation changes** by mapping vector fields through the simulated **strain field**; simulations **validated experimental observations**, giving molecular-level insight into chain motion.

### Engineering the Mechanics of Nanocomposites via Polymer-Conformation Programming  
*Advisors/Collaborators: Dr. Sinan Keten; Tiffany Chen; Dr. Ting Xu (UC Berkeley)*  
**2023 – 2024**

- Devised a **particle-based, micron-scale** simulation using **Lennard-Jones** interactions to replicate **nano-indentation** and compare moduli across systems.
- Matched the experimental **modulus trend** vs NP volume fraction and traced the higher stiffness in a specific system to **increased cohesion** from **optimal grafting density** and greater **activated polymer volume**—a mechanism not directly visible in experiments alone.

### Network Topology and Percolation in Model Covalent Adaptable Networks  
*Advisors/Collaborators: Dr. Sinan Keten; Benjamin Hafner; Dr. Kenneth Shull*  
**2023 – 2024**

- Developed coarse-grained models of **recyclable, disulfide-based** epoxies (LAMMPS + in-house MATLAB) to complement experimental **network-analysis**.
- Explored a **large design space** to locate the **percolation threshold**, finding strong agreement with **Flory’s mean-field theory**.
