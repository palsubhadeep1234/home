### Investigating Mechanical Properties of Multi-component Polymer-Grafted Nanoparticles  
*Advisors: Dr. Sinan Keten, Dr. Wei Chen, Dr. Ting Xu (UC Berkeley)*  
**2023 – Present**

- Constructed **molecular models** of multi-component PGNs with varying NP core radii and grafting densities, reproducing experimentally observed PGN superlattices and explaining their **mechanical responses**. The model reveals that **_NaCl_-like** MC-PGNs can achieve **higher modulus and toughness simultaneously** due to efficient packing.
- Implemented **Gaussian process (GP)** metamodels and **Bayesian optimization (BO)** to complement CG-MD and efficiently explore the design space—reducing uncertainty, building the **Pareto front**, and deriving **structure–property maps**.
